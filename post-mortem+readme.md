	1: What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

I would outline the big picture first so I would be able to prepare my 'tools' properly. EG: I made the mistake of rushing out a MVP with pure express and react without any scripts. However, when I decided to make pie charts etc, I realised that (not knowing how to transfer the data from jsx to script.js) I would have to re-do my entire code to make it AJAX centered (I didn't).

	2: What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

I started with MVC and was very organised throughout, console-logging each step so I was always aware of what was supposed to happen and if anything went wrong I knew the location of the error. I definitely became a more organised coder over the course of this project.



	1:What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

Like I said earlier, I would've planned around pie charts and made my code more script.js/AJAX focused.

Experimentation with SQL functions went well (timestamps, sums, other types like NUMERIC etc)

	I made an expenses planner that allowed you to create, edit and delete cards, list them and search for them, as well as sort them by field. I also added an Accounts overview which let me experiment with different SQL commands (eg. finding the largest creditor using SUM) 
	Used mostly express and react. virtually no DOM.
